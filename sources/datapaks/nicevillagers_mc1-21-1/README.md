## üìñ Description
**Nice Villagers Remastered** reworks and remasters many aspects of villagers to make them more enjoyable and fun. From randomized Villager & Village names over new structure to new trades, this data pack freshens up every world to make it more immersive.
<br><br>

## ‚≠ê Features
- Villagers can be leashed. Making transportation easier
- Villagers & Wandering Traders have randomized names based on their type
- Villages have randomized names based on the types of Villagers which live in there
- Trigger command for Villager Infos (Inventory, lvl, etc.) which also highlights the workbench the Villager has claimed
- Opening chests near a Villager gives it a bit of bad reputation towards the player (Why should only Piglins be angry if you take their stuff?!)
- Villagers have better or worse prices depending on whether they have a bed and/or meeting point (bell)
- Villagers & Iron Golems heal over time when they are near their Village centre (Bell) when it's daytime
- Some Villagers have small Fetch Quests, requiring the player to bring the items shown to it for a small reward.
- Wandering Traders sell Mobheads (They do have noteblock sounds. Fancy, right?!)
- Wandering Traders have a chance to sell enchanted treasure books
- Wandering Traders announce their presence with an neat, randomized message and fireworks. They also glow for a short period of time when spawning
- Wandering Traders have a chance to be a disguised Illusioner (indicated by particles)
- Villagers without a profession babble about certain topics in different moods when interacting with them
- Chance to change a Villagers type by giving it a certain item (Oak/Spruce/Jungle/Acacia Sapling, Mangrove Propagule, Snow, Dead Bush)
- Players can give Master Traders (lvl 5) certain items based on their profession which they then start selling (for an increased price because stonks)
- 7 new Structures: Villager Outposts which have a special Villager Trader inside who sells items based on its profession as well as miniblocks (which also have noteblock sounds. Still fancy, RIGHT!?)
- 20+ new Advancements (in case you are looking for a new challenge)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to, Instructions & Commands
The datapack usually just needs to be installed. There is nothing else you have to do. It just works out of the box.

But if you are playing on a PaperMC Server (or a PaperMC Fork like Purpur) make sure to set **allow-non-player-entities-on-scoreboards** in your paper config files to **true** in order for everything to work properly.

Villager Data Command: **/trigger villager_data**
