# PacMan
Merge all the Minecraft Datapacks :package:

## Usage
This repo contains a script `genpac.sh` that works its way through all the sources specified, and overlays them on eachother to create one massive datapack data folder that 
1. solves the issue of loading order for SpigotMC servers, and
2. allows for precise editing and changing from a known state.

It also allows for easy updating, as soon as a new datapack version comes out, just update the sources folder with the new version, change the name in the script, and re-generate!
